# BERSERK-MEDITATION

A simple tool to help berserk fans relax. I started reading Berserk recently and finished not too long ago. I was utterly devastated at the fact that a story like this
ended in the way it did and felt it needed more justice. This is my tribute to Kentaro and his work. I sympathized with Guts during his journeys and hope to one day be as strong
as him. I can only hope this page grants you serenity and eases your pain.
